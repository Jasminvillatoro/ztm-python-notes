# Fundamental Data Types

## int

Whole number

## float

Floating point number (decimal point)

## bool

boolean it can either be true or false

## str

A piece of text. Underneath the hood strings are stored in memory as an ordered sequence of characters.Python strings are "immutable" which means they cannot be changed after they are created.

## list

List in an ordered sequence of objects that can be of any type. -list are mutable.

`my_list = [1,2,3]`

## tuple

A tuple is like a list, but unlike lists we cannot modify them.They're immutable. A benefit we get from tuples is it lets other programmers know the values should remain constant.

`my_tuple = (1,2,3,4,5)`

## set

Sets are simply unordered collections of unique objects. They're are no duplicates.You can convert lists to sets or vice versa.

`my_set = {1,2,3,4,5}`

## dict

A dictionary is an unordered key value pair. In other languages it might be called objects, map, or hash table. It's a data structure.

`dictionary = { 'a' = 1,'b' = 2 }`

# Classes -> custom types

# Specialized Data Types

They're not built into Python, but they're special packages and modules that we can use from libraries

# None -nothing

Represents the absence of value.
